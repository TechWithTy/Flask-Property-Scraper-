Nestled in a small, quiet complex south of West University Ave. and north of Robinson Ave., this is a true turn-key opportunity for its next owner. Boasting an oversized upstairs primary suite, bathroom and walk-in closet, this home provides a sense of serenity despite the hustle and bustle of all things uptown only blocks away. In addition to a roomy primary suite, the second upstairs bedroom offers two closets for plenty of wardrobe space, plus private access to a roomy outdoor patio facing south toward downtown San Diego and San Diego International Airport. Both bedrooms have high-quality plantation shutters, allowing for easy natural lighting. This home also includes a single-car garage + 1 spot in the driveway, that's a TOTAL of TWO parking spots!

The downstairs living area is open and simple, allowing for an easy flow of conversation and activity while you rest or entertain. Being an end unit, you'll appreciate the extra natural light. The kitchen features well-maintained stainless-steel appliances and includes a beautiful stainless refrigerator, along with ample storage and counter-top space for many pleasurable cooking experiences. Between the kitchen and living area is an inviting bar-height counter-top perfect for morning coffee, casual dining or an evening glass of wine. You'll find plenty of storage in this townhome, including under the stairway storage! Located down the ground floor hallway is the guest powder room, along with direct access to a much-coveted attached garage with a newer high-lift garage door and garage door opener. Washer/dryer area is in the garage and includes a full-size washer dryer set (Samsung Front Load Flex Washer and Flex Dry Dryer) in terrific condition. Did we mention the home includes an additional driveway parking space, making for a total of TWO very valuable off-street parking spaces? This complex of only 5 homes is gated at both entrances, The location can't be beat!

The exterior features steep pitched roofs, original leaded glass windows, & a distinctive dome-shaped window with a Saint George crest.

Inside, the original Batchelder tiled foyer leads to a series of formal rooms adorned with textured plasterwork & wood molding. The house includes 5 bedrooms, 3 full baths, and a versatile 990 square foot attic, ideal for personalization. Preserved details like original light fixtures, built-ins, & a vintage stove contribute to its unique character, centered around a Batchelder tiled hearth. Modern updates include a new roof & fiberglass shingles, integrating historic elegance with contemporary comforts. Two private patios offer additional outdoor living space. This is a rare opportunity to own a piece of San Diego's architectural heritage. Barton Manor is a testament to enduring craftsmanship with a newly relined fireplace & chimney.
